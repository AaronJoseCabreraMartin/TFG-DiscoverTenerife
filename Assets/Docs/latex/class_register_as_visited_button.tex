\item If you dont have internet connection it will show an error on a toast message.
\item If the user is close enough it calls the user\+Visited\+Place\+By\+Name method of \mbox{\hyperlink{classfirebase_handler}{firebase\+Handler}}, the Check\+New\+State of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_visited_panel_controller}{Visited\+Panel\+Controller}} class and shows a toast message giving information to the user.
\item If the user is close enough but it cant visit again that place it shows a toast message telling to the user that he has to wait.
\item If the user is not close enough it shows a toast message with the error, telling the user that he has to be more more close to mark it as visited.
\end{DoxyItemize}

How many time the user has to wait between visiting the same place twice is defined on the \mbox{\hyperlink{classgame_rules}{game\+Rules}} class, as well as how close the user has to be to register a place as visited.
