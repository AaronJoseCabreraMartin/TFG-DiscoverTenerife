class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_change_scene}{Change\+Scene}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class follows the singleton pattern, the unique instance of the class can be found on an object with the tag \char`\"{}scene\+Manager\char`\"{}. It has to be instanciate because the coroutines cant be used in static methods, so if you need to use the change\+Scene\+With\+Animation method you have to have an instance of the class. It also has the public static method change\+Scene that allow change the active scene to other but without any transition. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
