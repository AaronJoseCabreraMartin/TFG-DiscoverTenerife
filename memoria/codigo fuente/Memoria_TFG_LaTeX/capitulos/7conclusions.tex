Most of the Canarian people need the comeback of the tourist situation of Canary Islands to pre-Covid levels. 
During this study, we have shown how a project of a gamified touristic application could be an incentive to make people move through and discover the whole Tenerife island. We also have shown the feasibility to make a reality this project.

We had made a marketing study and a competition study in order to increase the success probability of the project. Besides, we had created a Gantt diagram that proof that the project's deployment could be completed in 7 months. We, also, had made an approximation of the quantity of user that will use both applications and the web page, and with that approximation we had calculated the profits and the costs of having the application working in production. Thanks to this calculus, we have proved that the return of investment will be reached in a moderate time, 22 months.

As a conclusion, it has to be said that during this study we have demonstrated the viability, the benefits, and the potential of this project.
